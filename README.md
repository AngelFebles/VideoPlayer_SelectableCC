This project allows to play videos with subtitles which can be directly selected/copied from the player itself.  

It was created as a language learning tool to facilitate translating words from subtitles, and thus, it is recommended to be used alongside a mouseover dictionary browser extension (such as rikaikun or nazeka).

Video and subtitle files should be placed in the "files" directory and must share the same name. E.g., ThisIsATest.mp4 (video file) and ThisIsATest.srt (its respective subtitle file).

NodeJS is needed to launch project. Download from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).
